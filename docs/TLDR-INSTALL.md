# Slay the Jokers Mod - TL;DR Installation Guide

Only follow this guide if you just want to get the mod installed with as little hassle and sidetracking as possible.
If you need detailed instructions, explanations, or steps to back up your save, refer to the [full installation guide](../INSTALL.md).

## Instructions

1. Contact me at `itsedalo@gmail.com` to receive `upload.key`  
    - Absolutely no need for anything formal or polite, you can just say `Hi, I'm <twitch name>, give me a key`
    - Alternatively, you can get a key at https://edalo.net/stj/get-key (you will need to verify your Twitch account to prove it's really you).
        - This feature is new; if something fails, fall back to emailing me.
2. Download [Lovely](https://www.github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector/releases/tag/v0.7.1) 
3. Unzip it and move the `version.dll` file into the Balatro installation folder (where `Balatro.exe` is)
4. Download [this mod](https://github.com/its-edalo/slay-the-jokers/archive/main.zip)
5. Unzip it, move the unzipped folder into `%appdata%\Balatro\Mods` and **\*rename it\*** to `SlayTheJokers`
6. Place `upload.key` in the `SlayTheJokers` directory
7. Launch Balatro and wait for it to fully load.  
    - A black command window (part of `Lovely`) will appear
    - On first launch, it will automatically install required tools for this mod
8. After all installations are done, verify that the black window prints data upload messages periodically
9. Enable the [extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/iaofk5k6d87u31z9uy2joje2fwn347) on your Twitch channel
