    - *More formal disclaimer for meanies: this project is a hobby project, provided as-is, with no guarantees of stability, correctness, or suitability for any purpose. You're welcome to use it - but I take no responsibility if something goes wrong.*

- **Windows Only**: This mod currently supports only Windows systems.

- **Other Mods & Compatibility**: This mod has not been tested alongside other Balatro mods. Mods that add or modify cards are currently not compatible. QoL mods and other non-card-related mods should work, but have not been tested (except for the [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) mod, which was confirmed to work).

- **Privacy**: This mod *only uploads game-related data* (such as card positions) to the Slay the Jokers server - no personal or private information is collected. You can verify this by checking out `stj_save.lua` and `stj_uploader.py`.
