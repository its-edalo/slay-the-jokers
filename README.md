# "Slay the Jokers" Overlay Mod

âš¡ **Just want to install the mod quickly and don't care about anything else?** Follow the [TL;DR installation guide](docs/TLDR-INSTALL.md) for a fast setup.  
- However, I do recommend to continue reading instead, unless you've installed mods before.

## Overview

A mod that allows your viewers to hover over cards on your stream to see their effects and current values.

Does not require `steamodded`.

## Installation

The installation guide can be found [`here`](INSTALL.md). Be sure to **read the `Things to Know Before Installing` section below** before installing.

## Things to Know Before Installing

- **Upload Key**: To use this mod, you'll need an upload key to the Slay the Jokers server. You can get one in either of the following ways:
    - Email me at `itsedalo@gmail.com` and ask for a key.
        - Absolutely no need for anything formal or polite, you can just say `Hi, I'm <twitch name>, give me a key.`, word for word if you want. I'll try to send you the key quickly.
    - Use the automated system at https://edalo.net/stj/get-key (you will need to verify your Twitch account to prove it's really you).
        - This feature is new; if anything goes wrong, just fall back to emailing me.

- **Windows and Steam only**: This mod supports only the **Steam** version of the game on **Windows**.
    - The Xbox Game Pass PC version is not supported as it is incompatible with the required `Lovely` injector.

- **Stream Overlays**: This mod currently only works correctly if the game is shown at a 16:9 resolution (like 1920x1080 / 4K / 8K) and **fills the entire visible area of the stream**. Overlays that crop or reposition the game may cause card positions to misalign.
    - If that's a dealbreaker, feel free to contact me - I might be able to make it work for your setup.

- **Other Mods & Compatibility**: This mod should be compatible with most other mods.
    - Compatible mods:
        - Reskins, QoL mods, and other non-card-related mods should work in their entirety, but have not been tested (except for the [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) mod, which was confirmed to work).
        -  Mods that add new cards should generally work, aside from some potential minor formatting quirks. Among mods that were confirmed to work are [Extra Credit](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit), [Paperback](https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback), [Neato](https://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers), [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid), and [The Balatro Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayer).
    - Incompatible mods:
        - Mods that modify existing card effects are **not** compatible (the original card's effect will be shown instead).


- **Disclaimer**: This mod is still under development, so some features might not work perfectly. If you encounter any issues, please let me know!
    - *More formal disclaimer for meanies: this project is a hobby project, provided as-is, with no guarantees of stability, correctness, or suitability for any purpose. You're welcome to use it - but I take no responsibility if something goes wrong.*
